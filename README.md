## React application that uses SpotifyAPI to allow users to see:
 - Recently played tracks
 - Top listened artists
 - Top listened tracks

**Check it out [here](https://arthurwerle.github.io/Spotistics/)** :)

___

## How to run it locally:
 ### Prerequisites
  - NodeJS (I recommend LTS version)
  - Added your app to your **[Spotify For Developers Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)** and setted the correct redirect URL's
  
 ### Running
  - `npm i` to install dependencies
  - `npm start` to run the application
  
 ### Possible problems
  - You'll need to change the `clientId` variable in `src/config.js` to your clientID.
  - You'll need to change the `redirectUri` variable in `src/config.js` if you're using something different that `http://localhost:3000`
